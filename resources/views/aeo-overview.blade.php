                        “In our opinion, the Asian English Olympics event which was held at Binus University, displayed a positive outcome for our brand, Bantex. For the past few years, we were satisfied with the form of cooperation and communication in order to establish an ideal yet beneficial relationship between AEO and Bantex. It has made our brand become widely-known among Binus students. By using Bantex as the supporting product at the event, it helped AEO participants to capture immense recognition and quality of the products and notably created a positive image of AEO. Hopefully in the future, we can work together better.”

                    Indonesia is a country with its own customs, traditions, religion, and law. You should always respect them and be aware that your actions will not be offensive. That said, these are some tips on travelling in Indonesia to ensure you have a great time.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In culture and customs, the average population of Indonesia (also Jakarta), are predominantly Muslim. That's why every five times a day there's a call to prayer (adzan).</li>
                    <li>When talking to the natives, especially the elders, always be humble and polite. A little etiquette goes a long way in Indonesia</li>
                    <li>In Indonesia, especially in public places, it is better for everyone to dress modestly. BINUS University required everyone to follow a certain dress code when entering the campus: bottoms that go below your knees, sleeved shirts, and shoes. </li>
                    <li>Be polite in Indonesia when calling others. For older men, use the assigned pronoun "Bapak" (Sir) and for older women, "Ibu" (Madam). You can call someone “Kakak” (the gender-neutral term for older siblings) to address someone older. You can use “Adik” (the gender-neutral term for younger siblings) or call their first name to greet someone younger. </li>
                    <li>When people first meet, they usually shake hands. However, there are some people who prefer to bow with their hands folded instead of shaking hands. You may be mindful of that situation.</li>
                    <li>
                        There is a custom in Indonesia where people always use their right hands when communicating with another person or doing a specific task. Therefore, when shaking hands, giving something, or eating, most Indonesians use their right hands.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Indonesian society is very friendly and respectful. We hope you can follow those tips to adapt easier to Indonesian society.

            <div class="language mb-4">
                <h2 class="aeo-title fw-bold text-uppercase">language</h2>
                <p>
                    A large number of natives in Jakarta can speak English with varying degrees of fluency. However, the ability to speak English is not common to the natives of these cities. You are more likely to find English-speaking Indonesian in public places like hotels, shopping malls, and sports centres.

                <p>
                    You must drink bottled water and other drinks that are safe for consumption since the tap water is not suitable for consumption. We highly recommend you bring a bottle for drinking because we will provide water refills at BINUS University Anggrek campus.
                    Food from other South-East Asian countries is generally very similar in Indonesia. As most Indonesians are Muslims, finding halal food everywhere is easy. In Indonesia, hotels and shopping malls comply with high food hygiene standards and are usually safe for consumption. Please be aware that some of Indonesia's spicier variations may not suit people who have a sensitive digestion system.

                <p>
                    BMKG, the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency, predict that Indonesia's peak of the 2022/2023 rainy season will be between December 2020 and January 2023. We hope that February is no longer the rainy season, but we advise it is better to prepare a raincoat or an umbrella just in case.

            <div class="prohibited-action mb-4">
                <h2 class="aeo-title fw-bold text-uppercase">prohibited action</h2>
                <p>
                    In Indonesia, it is strictly illegal to take all kinds of illegal drugs, endangered trafficking in any kind of animal or gamble. The Indonesian authorities have a policy of zero tolerance and those caught face lengthy prison terms or a death sentence, in the worst-case scenario.
                    Please remember the Do and Don't and you'll have a great experience.

                <p>
                    The average wifi Internet speed in Indonesia is only 15.5 Mbps, and Indonesia's cellular Internet speed is around 10.5 Mbps. But don't worry, we're going to provide you with free wifi! Also, don't forget that Indonesia has a type of charger with 2 round holes for those of you who want to use the plugs to charge. Indonesia itself follows the Netherlands, which has used type F.
